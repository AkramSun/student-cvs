            Starting a 12 week IT training academy, I'm currently working to attain a ISTQB-ISEB. The course also contains Ruby and Ruby automation, Cucumber, Agile, Web Technology, Mobile and Databases. Within the academy, we are also training in areas of personal development in which we are learning to be more calibrated, capable testers. Learning from my past experiences with uni (Games and Media Tech, 2.1, Kingston) and previous work, I have been told that people can rely on me to be a dependable person which can help a team reach goals. I'm sure that my employers goals will become my goals and hopefully a long, prosperous future for us will emerge.
