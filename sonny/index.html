            <p>Starting a 12 week IT training academy, I'm currently working to attain a ISTQB-ISEB. The course also contains Ruby and Ruby automation, Cucumber, Agile, Web Technology, Mobile and Databases. Within the academy, we are also training in areas of personal development in which we are learning to be more calibrated, capable testers. Learning from my past experiences with uni (Games and Media Tech, 2.1, Kingston) and previous work, I have been told that people can rely on me to be a dependable person which can help a team reach goals. I'm sure that my employers goals will become my goals and hopefully a long, prosperous future for us will emerge.

                <strong>Freelance 3D Artist (Hard Surface Modelling Specialist)</strong><br>

                Freelance<br>
                August 2010 - August 2014 (4 years 1 month)<br>

                As a 3D Artist, I specialized in hard surface modelling, but also have experience with environment, organic modelling and animation. Though I had learning in university, many of the skills and understanding needed to become a capable 3D artist were self-taught, as self-development was strongly and consistently needed.

The models I created were compatible for either movies or games. I also made the relevant texture maps and other maps relevant to that object.<br>

                <strong>Sales Assistant</strong><br>

                World Duty Free<br>
                June 2011 - Present (3 years 4 months), Heathrow<br>

                Working in this role, I have managed various departments of the store. Though I was not on a management level, often there were times where taking a lead role and using my initiative was the way in making sure that the store ran to a high standard. Communication is also a key skill I've gained as clear communication to managers and customers was needed. Other skills I've developed here have been promoting, assisting others and organisation skills.<br>
