  <summary>I am currently being trained in the field of Development in Test, under the direct supervision of a very accomplished trainer who specializes in the field of software testing and web development. I am on track to learn commercial-level skills in Ruby programming as well as technical skills in Agile development particularly in automation testing using Watir, Selenium and RSpec.
  My personal goal is to realize the vision of the company that I am currently working in which is to provide high-caliber software testing support in whichever company I'll be working for. As a trainee, I am expected to become a highly skilled ISEB ISTQB accredited software tester which will provide me with the software testing foundations that I plan to develop further later in my career.

        <dname>The Benefits of Destination Dispatch Algorithms</dname>
        <dsummary>This was a dissertation that I did during my final year in university. I developed a GUI-based Java application that simulates and demonstrates performance differences between the SCAN algorithm and the Destination Dispatch algorithm when used in an elevator system. Thread programming is deeply integrated into the application and it also displays simulation statistics through line graphs generated using an open-source third-party Java library called JFreeChart.</dsummary>
